When given: Please fix issue $ARGUMENTS

Phases:

1. Investigate
   • gh issue view $ARGUMENTS  
   • Summarize the bug/feature request, relevant history (PRs, scratchpads), and code‑standards context.

2. Implement
   • Create branch: gh checkout -b issue/$ARGUMENTS  
   • Write or update tests first (TDD).  
   • Apply minimal, precise code changes.  
   • Commit with a one‑line summary if possible.

3. Deliver
   • Run full test suite; fix any failures.  
   • gh pr create --title "Fix: $ARGUMENTS" --body "See branch issue/$ARGUMENTS"  
   • Request review.

Always use `gh` for GitHub tasks. Minimize verbosity to save tokens but ensure your plan and code remain crystal clear.
